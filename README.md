# GWAS_tutorial
GWAS tutorial, with multiple versions. Short version for ConGen 2022, longer version for future teaching?
This tutorial will be paired with a seminar that introduces a whole bunch of case studies, including Susie's soay sheep, flycatchers (clutch size, but also all of the morphological traits from Silva et al!, and admixture mapping).

Simulations of categorical trait with one large effect locus and quantitative trait with 10 (still pretty large) effect loci.

We will simulate the data to use in GEMMA (both GEMMA LM and GEMMA BSLMM). While I will have the simulated big data set (with my set seed), I wil walk students through smaller data sets with their own set seeds, to show how sampling error (of both number of individuals and number of markers) will affect the results, even when there are markers of large effect!
